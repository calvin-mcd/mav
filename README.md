mav (mini alice van) handwired keyboard

This is my first handwired project. I wanted to make an alice style keyboard with minivan compatibility.

The project contains plate files and firmware for rp2040 MCUs.

I am *not responsible* for any outcomes of its use. However, feel free to edit, modify and otherwise utilise these files.

And finally, many thanks for the amazing people on the Vial Discord Server for helping me make the firmware work!

Any questions, contact Calvin#0563 on Discord.
