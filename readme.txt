This is my first handwired project. The keyboard is inspired by both the alice layout and minivan form factor as it has minivan sized mods.
Hence the name mav (mini alice van). The layout could probably be improved but it is my first foray into designing a keyboard myself.

The plate files are a bit out dated as the screw holes on the final result had been moved slightly inwards to avoid a weak point in the acrylic plates and risking to break them. So beware when using the files. they are old!

the Firmware is compiled to work with vial, but is currently running on a pico pi. I include the source files if it needs to be adapted.
